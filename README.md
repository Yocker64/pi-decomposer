# pi-decomposer
Just some python code to encode pi digits into a system of pair of digits and keyword in order to facilitate memorization. 

In order to use this code you just have to change the dictionary values with your custom ones.

I am just experimenting with this type of memorization technique, there is plenty of research about how to memorizate stuff more efficiently and I came up with my own technique in which I pair the name of some consonants to a number, then I just create two sylable or so words that are easy to remember that have those only two consonants in the same order as the number, example: 12-> "1" can either translate into "d" or "t", and "2" can only be translated as "n". So, a codified word for 12 would be "tuna"! 

As simple as that: you have the phonetic code below. I do not recommend changing it since it has been researched that this is one of the better ways to encode numbers using the alphabet since the number of conflicts is very low, but as always, it is just a recommendation and you are free to experiment with your own custom encoding system :D

0-> s,z
1-> t,d
2-> n
3-> m
4-> r
5-> l
6-> sh, ch, j
7-> k, g
8-> y, f
9-> b, p
